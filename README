Discord Role Bot
This is a Discord bot that allows you to assign roles to members for a specified number of days. After the specified number of days, the role will be automatically removed from the member.

Setup
Install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add your bot token and allowed user IDs as follows:
BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
ALLOWED_USERS=user_id_1,user_id_2,user_id_3

Run the bot using python bot.py.
Usage
To assign a role to a member, use the !addrole command followed by the member mention, role mention, and number of days. For example:

!addrole @member @role 7

This will assign the specified role to the mentioned member for 7 days.

Only users with IDs specified in the ALLOWED_USERS environment variable are allowed to use this command.

The bot will check every minute for roles that have expired and remove them from members. Members will also receive a message 5 days before their role is removed.
